# Python Intro 01

- Python is a high level language that is a intepreted language.

- There are broadly 2 types of langauges - Compiled langauges and Interpreted Langauge

#Compiled Language

- In the case of a compiled language, the source code goes through the compiler before getting passed to the computer.

#Interpreted Language

-  In the case of an interpreted langauge, the source code is read by the interpreter line by line and then converted to object code before being passed to the computer.
-  What this means is that if there is an error in 1 line of the source code, then python will still continue to run while other compiled languages will not run (e.g. C++)


- In the case of python, the Python Virtual Machine (which is written in C language) is the interpreter.
